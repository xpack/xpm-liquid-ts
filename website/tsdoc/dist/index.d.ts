/**
 * A Node.js TypeScript module with the core code for <b>xpm</b> and
 * <b>xpm enabled</b> projects.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This library groups together various classes and functions used in common
 * by <b>xpm</b> and the Visual Studio Code extension.
 *
 * The main functionality is to manage actions and build configurations,
 * especially those defined using Liquid templates.
 *
 * <h3>The Lazy Evaluation Mechanism</h3>
 *
 * Actions ({@link XpmActions}) and build configurations
 * ({@link XpmBuildConfigurations}) implement a two-step lazy evaluation
 * process to avoid unnecessary operations:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>Name Expansion:</b> During collection initialisation, only
 *    the matrix of
 *    options is evaluated for each template, expanding template names into
 *    concrete action or configuration names without processing their
 * content.</li>
 * <li><b>Content Evaluation:</b> Later, when an action or build
 *    configuration is  actually accessed and initialised (via
 *    <code>XpmAction.initialise()</code>
 *    or <code>XpmBuildConfiguration.initialise()</code>), the template
 *    is fully
 *    evaluated and Liquid substitutions are performed.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * This approach ensures that only items that are actually used incur the cost
 * of template evaluation and variable substitution, significantly improving
 * performance for projects with many actions or configurations.
